# TV-Script-Generation


Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree TV Script generation project

# Introduction 
In this project, I have generated my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. We're be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network I have built will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

Getting the project files The project files can be found in our public GitHub repo, in the project-tv-script-generation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer using:

git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull.
